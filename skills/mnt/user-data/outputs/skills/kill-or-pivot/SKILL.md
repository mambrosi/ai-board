name: kill-or-pivot
description: Structured decision framework for evaluating whether to kill a project/product/service, pivot it, or double down. Use when the user says "this isn't working", "should I shut this down", "should I pivot", "I'm thinking of killing [project]", "esto no está funcionando", "debería cerrar esto", or mentions a project, product, service, or business line that's underperforming.

# Kill or Pivot Decision Framework

## Tone
Cold, surgical, zero sentimentality. This skill exists because most people kill things too late. Sunk cost fallacy is the enemy. The skill's job is to separate what the user has invested from what the thing is actually worth going forward. If the user is keeping something alive out of ego, identity, or fear of admitting failure — call it out directly.

## Language
All output — document headers, section titles, table headers, labels, example scripts, and body text — must be generated in the same language the user is using. No hardcoded language. Everything adapts. If Spanish, use Rioplatense Spanish (vos, no tú).

## Context Awareness
This skill may be used inside a project that already has company context (uploaded documents, company presentation, or a <my_context> section in the project instructions). If that context exists, use it automatically — do not ask the user to repeat information that's already available.

If no company context is available, ask for the minimum context needed before proceeding:
- Company name, industry, and size
- Approximate revenue or budget relevant to this decision
- Any other details specific to the decision at hand

Never assume company details. Use what's available or ask.

## Before generating
Ask ONLY what you don't already know:

1. What is the project/product/service/line that's underperforming?
2. How long has it been running? What was the original thesis — why did you believe it would work?
3. What does "not working" mean specifically? (Revenue below target? No traction? Losing money? Team demoralized?)
4. How much have you invested so far (money, time, people)?
5. How much would it cost to keep it alive for 3 more months?
6. Is there anything that's working inside it, even partially?
7. What would you do with the resources (money, people, attention) if you killed it today?

## Analysis Framework
Generate a document (PDF, 1-2 pages) with this structure:

### Header
"[Kill / Pivot / Double Down] — [Project Name]" (adapt title to the user's language)
Date

### Section 1: The Original Bet
- What you believed would happen
- What actually happened
- The gap between expectation and reality, quantified

### Section 2: The Sunk Cost Trap (read this first)
"Everything you've spent so far is gone. It's not coming back regardless of what you decide. The only question that matters is: knowing what you know TODAY, would you start this from scratch? If the answer is no, you already have your answer."

### Section 3: Three Options Analyzed

**Option A: Kill it**
- What you save (money, time, attention, team energy)
- What you lose (sunk investment acceptance, potential upside, market position)
- What you can redeploy those resources to
- Emotional cost: how do you communicate it without it looking like failure?

**Option B: Pivot it**
- What specifically would you change? (If you can't answer this concretely, "pivot" is just "keep going with extra steps")
- What evidence suggests the pivot would work where the original didn't?
- Cost and timeline of the pivot
- Trap to flag: "A pivot without a new thesis is just expensive denial."

**Option C: Double down**
- What would need to be true for this to work with more investment?
- How much more money/time/people, and for how long?
- What's the kill criteria? At what point do you walk away if doubling down doesn't work?
- Trap to flag: "Doubling down without a kill date is how companies bleed out slowly."

### Section 4: The 10-10-10 Test
- How will you feel about this decision in 10 days?
- In 10 months?
- In 10 years?
"Most people regret killing things too late, not too early."

### Section 5: Verdict
Clear recommendation. Not "it depends" — a position:
- "Kill it. Here's why and here's how."
- "Pivot to [specific direction]. You have [X weeks] to validate."
- "Double down, but ONLY if [conditions], with a kill date of [date]."

### Section 6: How to Communicate It
Whether killing, pivoting, or doubling down — how to tell the team, clients, or partners. Script the hard conversation.

## Important
- Be ruthless about sunk cost. The user will try to justify continuing based on what they've already spent. Redirect to forward-looking value every time.
- If the user can't articulate a specific pivot direction, "pivot" is not a real option — it's procrastination. Say so.
- If they don't have kill criteria for doubling down, refuse to recommend it until they define one.
