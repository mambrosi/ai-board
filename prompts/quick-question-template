# Quick Template for Board Consultation

Copy, paste, fill in, done. Short and direct answers are enough — no need to write an essay.

## Copy and paste:

**Situation:** [What's happening? 2-3 sentences.]

**The decision or problem:** [What do you need to resolve or decide?]

**What's at stake:** [What happens if it goes well? What happens if it goes wrong?]

**What I'm leaning toward:** [What are you thinking of doing today?]

**What's holding me back:** [What doubt, fear, or piece of data has you stuck?]

## Completed example:

**Situation:** My sales manager of 8 years just told me he's leaving in 60 days. He handles 70% of our client relationships.

**The decision or problem:** Do I promote someone internal who lacks experience, hire externally, or restructure the department?

**What's at stake:** If I choose wrong, I could lose key clients during the transition. If I choose right, it's a chance to professionalize the department.

**What I'm leaning toward:** Promote the second-in-command and hire a junior to support him.

**What's holding me back:** I don't know if the second-in-command has real leadership ability or if he's just loyal and has seniority.

## Tips

- It doesn't have to be perfect. "What's holding me back" can be a gut feeling, a fear, a data point — whatever it is.
- If you don't know what you're thinking of doing, write "No idea, I need options" — the board works just the same.
- If you want the board to focus on a specific angle, add at the end: "Start with the Director Financiero" or "Have the Abogado del Diablo tear it apart first."
