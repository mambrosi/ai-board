## Text to copy and paste:

I have an industrial cleaning services company with 45 employees and we generate USD 1.2M per year with an 18% margin. A mining company contacted us for a 3-year contract that would represent an additional USD 400k per year, but it requires:

- Investing USD 80k in specialized equipment
- Hiring 12 new people
- Relocating part of the operation 300km from the city
- Exclusivity in the mining sector (I couldn't serve any other mining company)

My largest competitor turned down this contract due to its complexity. My current team is at 85% capacity.

What do you think? Afterwards I'd like to vote.

---

## What to expect:

The board should give you 6 different perspectives on this dilemma. Pay attention to:

- **CFO:** Will analyze the ROI on the 80k investment vs. the additional revenue
- **Head of Revenue:** Will question the exclusivity and revenue concentration
- **COO:** Will flag the current 85% capacity and the risk of overextending
- **Head of People:** Will evaluate the impact of hiring 12 people and relocating part of the team
- **Devil's Advocate:** Will ask why the larger competitor turned it down
- **Strategic Mentor:** Will ask if this is what you really want for your company

After the first response, try saying "I need to make a decision" to see the vote.

# 🏛️ Board Session: Mining Contract Evaluation

**💰 El Número (CFO):**

Let's cut through this. USD 400k/year × 3 years = USD 1.2M total revenue. At your current 18% margin, that's ~USD 72k/year profit — but that's optimistic because mining ops have higher costs. The USD 80k equipment investment pays back in just over a year *if* margins hold, which is decent. But here's what worries me: 12 new hires at, let's say, USD 800-1,200/month each (industrial cleaning in LatAm) is USD 115k-170k/year in payroll alone, plus relocation costs, logistics for a site 300km away, supervision overhead, and equipment maintenance in harsh mining conditions. **Run the real numbers — I suspect your margin on this contract drops to 8-12%, not 18%.** Also: what happens at year 3 when the contract ends? You're stuck with 12 people, specialized equipment with limited resale value, and a remote operation to dismantle. What's the exit cost?

---

**📈 El Revenue (CRO):**

A 33% revenue jump is significant — you go from USD 1.2M to USD 1.6M. That's a real step change. But the exclusivity clause is a trap. Mining is one of the highest-paying industrial cleaning sectors, and you're locking yourself out of the entire vertical for one client. **You're not gaining a market — you're renting access to a single customer.** If this contract works well, you want to be able to leverage that track record to win 3 more mining clients, not sit on your hands. My question: is the exclusivity negotiable? Because the contract without exclusivity is a completely different conversation. Also — your competitor said no. That's either a red flag or an opportunity. Find out *why* they said no before you decide.

---

**⚙️ La Ejecución (COO):**

You're at 85% capacity with 45 people. That means you have roughly 6-7 people's worth of slack. You need 12 new hires — people you don't have yet, for a specialized environment you've never operated in, 300km away where supervision becomes a logistics nightmare. **Who runs this operation on-site?** You'll need to pull a senior manager from your current business or hire one, and both options hurt. Mining environments have strict safety protocols, certifications, and compliance requirements — do you have those? Your current operation also gets riskier: at 85% capacity you have buffer; if you pull anyone to help launch the mining site, your core business runs hot. One sick leave wave and you're dropping the ball on existing clients.

---

**👥 El Líder (Head of People):**

Twelve new hires in industrial cleaning 300km from the city — who are these people? You're either relocating existing employees (destroying their personal lives and risking attrition in your core team) or hiring locally near the mine (people you don't know, can't supervise easily, and who have no loyalty to your culture). Mining sites are tough environments with high turnover. **Your current team's morale matters too** — if your best people see you stretching thin on a risky bet, and their workload increases because you pulled resources, you risk losing the talent that built your USD 1.2M business while chasing an extra USD 400k. Who's going to lead this remote team? That person is the whole ballgame.

---

**🔴 El Destructor (Devil's Advocate):**

Your biggest competitor said no. Stop and think about *why*. They have more resources than you and they still walked away. You're telling yourself this is your big opportunity — I'm telling you it might be the contract that breaks your company. Here's what you're assuming without verifying: that the mining company is financially stable for 3 years, that the contract terms protect you if they reduce scope or delay payments (mining companies are notorious for this), that you can recruit 12 people for a remote site quickly and cheaply, that your equipment investment is recoverable, and that your core business runs fine while your attention is 300km away. **What happens if the mining company suspends operations in year 2 due to commodity prices?** What are the penalty and termination clauses? You're a USD 1.2M company about to take on a contract that represents 33% of your revenue from a single client in an industry you've never served. That's not diversification — that's concentration risk with a side of operational complexity.

---

**🧭 El Espejo (Strategic Mentor):**

I want to ask you something before the numbers: **why does this excite you?** Is it because it's genuinely the right strategic move, or because a big company called *you* and your competitor said no, and your ego is telling you this is your moment to prove something? There's a version of this where you take a massive risk, stretch your company and your life thin, spend months managing a remote operation you've never run, and come out the other side with 8% margins and gray hair. Is that the life you're building toward? You built a solid USD 1.2M business with 18% margins. That's real. The question isn't "can I do this?" — it's "should I, given everything it will cost me beyond money?"

---

## ⚖️ Summary

**Points of agreement:**
- The exclusivity clause is a major red flag and should be negotiated or eliminated
- The real margin on this contract is almost certainly lower than 18% — possibly significantly lower
- Operational complexity of a remote site with new hires in an unfamiliar sector is high risk
- Need to understand *why* the competitor declined before deciding
- The termination/exit clauses are critical unknowns

**Points of tension:**
- Revenue growth potential (📈) vs. concentration risk and margin erosion (💰, 🔴)
- Strategic opportunity to enter mining vs. distraction from core business optimization
- Ambition vs. operational readiness — the company may not be built for this yet

## 🗳️ Board Vote

| Director | Vote | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 💰 El Número | **Against** | Numbers likely don't work at projected margins. Exit risk is unpriced. Need full P&L model before reconsidering. |
| 📈 El Revenue | **With conditions** | Only if exclusivity is removed or limited, and only if it opens a path to more mining clients. Otherwise you're renting revenue, not building a market. |
| ⚙️ La Ejecución | **Against** | You don't have the people, processes, or experience to run a remote mining operation safely. Not ready today. |
| 👥 El Líder | **With conditions** | Only if you identify a strong on-site leader first *and* can hire locally without cannibalizing your core team. No leader, no deal. |
| 🔴 El Destructor | **Against** | Too many unverified assumptions. A USD 1.2M company taking a complex, remote, single-client bet in an unknown sector is how companies go under, not how they grow. |
| 🧭 El Espejo | **With conditions** | Only if you can honestly say this aligns with the business and life you want — not just the ego boost of a big contract. And only after negotiating fundamentally different terms. |

**Result: 3 Against / 3 With Conditions / 0 In Favor**

**Board recommendation:** **Don't take this contract as presented.** But don't walk away from the relationship either. Go back to the mining company and negotiate: remove or limit exclusivity, request a longer contract (5 years) to justify the investment, negotiate equipment cost-sharing or an advance, and ensure ironclad termination protection. If they say no to all of that, they're telling you who bears all the risk — and it's you.
