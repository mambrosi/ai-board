## Text to copy and paste:

I have an industrial cleaning services company with 45 employees and we generate USD 1.2M per year with an 18% margin. A mining company contacted us for a 3-year contract that would represent an additional USD 400k per year, but it requires:

- Investing USD 80k in specialized equipment
- Hiring 12 new people
- Relocating part of the operation 300km from the city
- Exclusivity in the mining sector (I couldn't serve any other mining company)

My largest competitor turned down this contract due to its complexity. My current team is at 85% capacity.

What do you think? Afterwards I'd like to vote.

## What to expect:

The board should give you 6 different perspectives on this dilemma. Pay attention to:

- **CFO:** Will analyze the ROI on the 80k investment vs. the additional revenue
- **Head of Revenue:** Will question the exclusivity and revenue concentration
- **COO:** Will flag the current 85% capacity and the risk of overextending
- **Head of People:** Will evaluate the impact of hiring 12 people and relocating part of the team
- **Devil's Advocate:** Will ask why the larger competitor turned it down
- **Strategic Mentor:** Will ask if this is what you really want for your company

After the first response, try saying "I need to make a decision" to see the vote.
